# Brain-Tumor-Detection
* A deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Network to predict tumorous and non-tumorous tissues based on histopathological dataset. 
* The custom model had an accuracy of 81%. Pretrained Mobilenet model was used which increased accuracy upto 96%.

* Images of Brain MRI scans are collected and used as Dataset for the project. For the project, 253 images of both tumorous Brain MRI scans and non-tumorous brain MRI scans are taken.

* The datasets are passed through a Convolutional Neural Network. In our project, only one layer of Neural Network is built. The Rectified Linear Unit[ReLU] and Sigmoid are used as Activation functions, Adaptive Momentum[Adam] is used as an optimizer in our project.

* We can pass a Brain MRI Image in our model and find whether the person to whom the MRI Scan belongs to is suffering from a Brain Tumor or not.
